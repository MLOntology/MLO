# Machine Learning Ontology Research

## 1. Preliminaries

The **ml-ontology-202004211011-09.owl** file (Protégé compatible), is an ontology in the Machine Learning domain, including algorithms, problems, tools, and other associated features.

### In this version, here are some of the Ontology Metrics in Protégé's Active Ontology.
- Axiom: 10,690
- Logical axiom count: 4,892
- Class count: 2,282
- Object property count: 56

## 2. Introduction

Machine Learning Ontology (MLO) is built using Protégé and is based on seven higher level
classes visible in the figure below:

The main characteristics of these seven highest level classes are:

- **Algorithms:** A set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations, which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations, and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure. 
- **Applications:** the action of putting something into operation.
- **Dependencies:** What are the prerequisites for solving an algorithm or problem and what are the requirements for a tool to be executed.
- **Dictionary:** Acronyms, nicknames and texts for which an interpretation is required.
- **FrameWorks:** A set of tools and associated utilities for solving and implementing algorithms, problems or applications
- **Involved:** People or institutions that created and improved the available resources to facilitate the use and application of Machine Learning. 
- **Types:** Usual classification of Machine Learning algorithms..

## 3. Collaboration in the MLO construction

One of the main motivations for the creation of Machine Learning Ontology (MLO) is a
model to support autonomous agents in applications over the Internet Infrastructure, called
Structure for Knowledge Acquisition, Use, Learning and Collaboration (SKAU). A
partial view of SKAU can be seen in Figure 2.

The agents of the proposed model are part of another model called Autonomous Architecture
Over Restricted Domains (A2RD) that makes use of a knowledge base, whose content is
formed by other ontology bases, among other forms of knowledge representation (BRAGA,
2019). The other components of the partial SKAU environment can be ignored in this context.
An ontology like MLO is very large and complex. The chances of success in an undertaking like
this depend on the collaboration of two key stakeholders: (a) the human being, collaborating in
the construction, updating and/or complement the MLO through small others ontologies and
(b) autonomous agents dedicated to ensuring the construction of ontologies from unstructured
databases, such as manuals, Web sites, among others, ensuring that all information collected
and of interest to the MLO is properly updated. Agents are exclusive collaborators with very
specific guidelines. Therefore, they can only serve the production of axioms in the .owl format.
Humans can collaborate over .owl files and benefit from the entire knowledge base in the SKAU
environment.

The collaboration mechanism is an extremely sensitive process and must follow well-established
rules. For this reason, a model was designed as shown in the Figure 3.
