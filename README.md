# Machine Learning Ontology Research

Sorry, but this README.md is under construction. 

The **ml-ontology-202004141049-08.owl** file (Protégé compatible), is an ontology in the Machine Learning domain, including algorithms, problems, tools, and other associated features.

#### In this version, here are some of the Ontology Metrics in Protégé's Active Ontology.
- Axiom: 10,024
- Logical axiom count: 4,368
- Class count: 2,221
- Object property count: 54

The MLO is built from six classes of the highest level, which can be seen in the figure below:

#### The main characteristics of these seven highest level classes are:
- **Algorithms:** A set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations, which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations, and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure. 
- **Applications:** the action of putting something into operation.
- **Categories:} a procedure, technique, or technique of doing something, especially in accordance with a definite plan.
- **Dependencies:** What are the prerequisites for solving an algorithm or problem and what are the requirements for a tool to be executed.
- **Dictionary:** Acronyms, nicknames and texts for which an interpretation is required.
- **FrameWorks:** A set of tools and associated utilities for solving and implementing algorithms, problems or applications
- **Involved:** People or institutions that created and improved the available resources to facilitate the use and application of Machine Learning.
